# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game built using Python's turtle module and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
The game includes a snake that moves across the screen, consumes food, and grows longer while keeping track of the score.
The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.

## Features
- You can control the snake's direction using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- The snake grows longer and the score increases when it eats food.
- The game ends when the snake hits the walls or its own body.
- The game tracks the player's score when the snake eats the food and displays it on the screen.

## How to Play
- Clone or download the repository.
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Run the following script to start the game: `python main.py`

Enjoy the game and happy coding!
